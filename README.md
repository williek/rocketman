### Objective

Your assignment is to implement a website showcasing and notifying visitors about
the next SpaceX rocket launch and displaying details about upcoming rocket launches.
Use JavaScript and React.

### Brief

You are the last frontend developer on earth. Everyone wants to leave for Mars
to live a safer, cooler life there. The one problem is, people need to know when the next launch
is happening, and that's where you come into the picture. You decide to build a website that informs
the public about the next launch and information about future launches.

Everyone is counting on you!

### Tasks

-   Implement assignment using:
    -   Language: **JavaScript**
    -   Framework: **React**
-   Build out the project to the designs inside the `/Designs` folder
-   Connect your application to the **SpaceX-API** (Docs: `https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/#readme`)
-   Use the API to build two screens/sections like in the design
-   The countdown should be live and specify days, hours, minutes, and seconds
-   The 'Upcoming Launches' screen/section should display the mission name, date, and launchpad like in the design
-   The countdown and upcoming launches table can be implemented either in separate screens (implement navigation)
    or simply with different sections in the page, try to make them intuitive and fluid
-   Add a share button for social media platforms to share the next launch with friends
-   Fetching should be done safely, with a fallback when an error occurs
-   Each launch should have a 'Bookmark' or 'Favorite' button that adds it to a separate 'Favorites' section. We would like to see the use of the localStorage API here (either save the launches data or its id)

### API Endpoints

-   Next Launch Counter: 'https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/blob/master/docs/launches/v4/next.md'
-   Upcoming Launches: 'https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/blob/master/docs/launches/v4/upcoming.md'

A simple GET request will provide you all the data needed for the tasks without requiring any authentication.

### Deliverables

Make sure to include all source code in the repository.

### Evaluation Criteria

-   **JavaScript** best practices
-   Show us your work through your commit history
-   Completeness: did you complete the features?
-   Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
-   Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
-   Testing: is the system adequately tested? do your components have unit tests?
-   Responsiveness and full mobile compatibility
-   Elegantly use placeholders/skeletons when fetching data
-   Effective use of the localStorage API

### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test, and document your code as if it were
going into production - then push your changes to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

All the best and happy coding,
